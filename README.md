# PowerShell Practical Exercise

The following practical exercise is intended to assess your level of knowledge and proficiency in the use of PowerShell. There is not a “correct” answer to this exercise, but rather your response will be used to evaluate your current level of skill in the use of PowerShell as a tool. If you do not have any experience with PowerShell, that is ok too. 

During the interview you will be asked to explain solution that you submitted. Be prepared to explain both what improvements you made and why you made them.

## Steps:
1.	Download the PowerShell script from the following Github location:
  -	https://github.com/<repo for applicant>
2.	Review the code and make changes to implement the following features:
  -	Readability – Rewrite the script that is more readable
  -	Error correction – The script should handle errors gracefully and return useful errors
  -	Functions – Separate the script into function to eliminate the rewriting of code
  -	Output – Create either a CSV file that contains the results of the script – the name of the file should include the year, month, date, hour, and minute that the file was created (Example: 2022-04-11-12-01-Data.xml)

## Bonus points:
  -	Clone the repository, create a new branch, and submit a Pull Request with your updated code
  -	Write the script as a PowerShell module
  - Output the data to an XML file instead of CSV
